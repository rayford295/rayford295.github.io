# üó® About Me
My name is Yifan Yang, and I am a first-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Geography at Texas A&M University. I have the honor of working with my advisor, Dr. Lei Zou, in the Geospatial Exploration and Resolution (GEAR) Lab (https://www.geoearlab.com). My research focuses on the integration of Spatial Science and GeoAI, utilizing GIS & Remote Sensing for mapping and analyzing geographic patterns, exploring Disaster Resilience, understanding Climate Change impacts, and investigating Public Health. In addition, I am deeply committed to Responsible GIS and GeoAI, particularly in enhancing Explainable GeoAI for improved interpretability in decision-making across critical fields.

Before entering PhD studies, I earned a master's degree in spatial data science from the University of Southern California (https://www.usc.edu/). During my master's degree, I worked with Dr. John Wilson about urban tree(https://publicexchange.usc.edu/urban-trees-initiative/). and Dr. Siqin Wang gave me a lot of guidance.

Before graduate school, I received a bachelor's degree in software engineering from Hainan University in China (https://www.hainanu.edu.cn/).  I hope to use computer science and spatial science to make some contribution to the world. I am also an AI4science enthusiast. My hobbies are basketballüèÄ, football‚öΩ, pokerüé¥ and talk showüéÜ.
