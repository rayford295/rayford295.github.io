# ðŸ—¨ About Me
My name is Yifan Yang and I am currently pursuing a Master of Science in Spatial Data Science at the University of Southern Californiaï¼ˆhttps://www.usc.edu/ï¼‰, maintaining an exemplary 4.0 GPA. Before that, I got a bachelorâ€™s degree in software engineering from Hainan Universityï¼ˆhttps://www.hainanu.edu.cn/ï¼‰ in China, majoring in big data.

From August 2023 to May 2024, I will be honored to be with John Wilson(https://spatial.usc.edu/team-view/john-p-wilson/), PhD, Professor of Sociology and Space Science; Yi Qi, PhD, Associate Professor (Teaching) of Space Science: Beau MacDonald, GIS Program Administrator, Working together on Phase III of the USC Urban Trees Initiative: Geospatial Analysis of the City and County of Los Angeles as a Masterâ€™s Research Assistant.

During my academic career, I have been fortunate to be involved in many innovative research projects. In the summer vacation of 23 years, I used remote sensing satellite images combined with SAM to analyze the status quo of urban layout. Under the tutelage of Professors Darren Ruddell(https://spatial.usc.edu/team-view/darren-ruddell/) and Diana Ter-Ghazaryan(https://spatial.usc.edu/team-view/diana-k-ter-ghazaryan/), I was able to leverage the capabilities of ArcGIS and Python to improve and optimize urban greening strategies.

Additionally, I worked with Vitally AI to support the CTOâ€™s handling of the neural networks that are at the heart of generative AI. This experience immerses me in the entire life cycle of an AI model - from data collection to fine-tuning.

My research interests are not limited to a single field. I also applied my knowledge to the field of medical technology. My advisor is Professor Cheng Jierenï¼ˆhttps://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37595925800ï¼‰ from Hainan University. During the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, I was part of a team that used federated learning to analyze chest X-ray images to detect COVID-19 infection, using various models such as MobileNet_v2 and ResNeXt. At the same time, I was also involved in a project aimed at monitoring public sentiment on the epidemic using advanced algorithms to process and visualize Weibo data. These two studies have successfully published papers respectively. For details, please refer to my Google Scholar homepage(https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=B-fiSHwAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN).

In addition, I had the honor to participate in the CIS research course project of Prof. David P. Woodruff(http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dwoodruf/) at Carnegie Mellon University, which deepened my understanding of big data algorithm models and contributed to the publication of papers on this topic.
