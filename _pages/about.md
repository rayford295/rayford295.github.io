# ðŸ—¨ About Me
My name is Yifan Yang, and I am currently pursuing a master's degree in spatial data science at the University of Southern California (https://www.usc.edu/), with a GPA of 4.0. Before that, I got a bachelor's degree in software engineering from Hainan University in China (https://www.hainanu.edu.cn/), majoring in big data. My current plan is to apply for a PhD in space science, geoAI, and spatial analysis. This is also my interest. I hope to use computer science and space science to make some contributions to the world. I am also an AI4science enthusiast. My hobbies are basketball, football, poker, and talk shows.
